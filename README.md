# Forecasting Tesla's Stock Prices

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast Tesla's stock prices using a combination of time-series analysis and sentiment analysis derived from Twitter data. Employing machine learning and deep learning methodologies, the project analyzes historical stock data and sentiment metrics to predict future price movements.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes two primary data sources:
- **Historical Stock Data (`TSLA.csv`, `tsla_stock_price.csv`)**: Includes daily stock prices of Tesla, detailing open, high, low, and close prices along with volume traded.
- **Twitter Data (`tweet_tesla_data.csv`)**: Contains extracted tweets related to Tesla, used for sentiment analysis to understand public perception and its impact on stock prices.

## Methodologies
- **Time Series Analysis**: Applying statistical techniques to model and forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing Twitter data to gauge public sentiment and its correlation with stock price fluctuations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **NLTK & VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer**: For processing and analyzing text data.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentations.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or similar.
- **Python Version**: 3.8 or newer.
- **Required Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- **Hardware**: Recommended to have at least 16GB RAM and sufficient disk space.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Python 3.8 or newer.
   - Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries).
3. **Running the Notebooks**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository via Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run each cell to see the analysis and results.

## How to Use
- Navigate to the notebook containing the time-series analysis to view the modeling of stock prices based on historical data.
- Explore the sentiment analysis notebook to understand the impact of public sentiment on Tesla's stock prices.
- Adjust parameters and models as needed to experiment with different forecasting techniques.
