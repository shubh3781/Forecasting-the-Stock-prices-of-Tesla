Objectives -
• The goal of this research is to f ind the most eff icient machine learning or deep learning algorithms to predict Tesla stock prices along with time series analysis.
• Along with time-series analysis, sentiment-based analysis has been used to investigate how tweets affect the price of Tesla stocks.
• Imported two different datasets in Jupyter Notebooks; for sentiment analysis, tweet data was extracted by using Twitter API and for Time series analysis, collected historical data from the Yahoo finance website.
• To perform Time Series Analysis, pre-processed the dataset by removing outliers and Null values to get ready for Machine Learning models.
• Conv-RNN, Conv-LSTM, and Conv-BILSTM algorithms were used to identify the lowest value of MAE to predict the Tesla Predicted Stock Prices.
• Tweepy Python library is used to fetch the tweeets on Tesla Stock Prices from Twitter.
• To perform deep learning and machine learning algorithms, pre-processed the data with cleanliness, generalizations, and removing null values and unwanted columns.
• NLTK approach was used to classify the text data into three sentiment categories - positive, negative, and neutral.
• DNN, Catboost and Random Forest Classifier models were used to predict the real stock prices of Tesla.
• Comparing all the models on the basis of MAE score i.e. Mean Absolute Error and resulted that Conv-LSTM and Catboost algorithm performed better for time series and sentiment analysis respectively.
• Followed the Data Governance Ethics rules to use external data for personal project analysis.
